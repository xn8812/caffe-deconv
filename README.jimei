To train the generative CNN for chair images, please follow the steps below.
1. modify the Makefile.config according to your system.
2. compile caffe and matcaffe.
3. download and unzip the chair images by running data/chairs/get_chairs.sh
4. open MATLAB in the caffe-share root and run init_matcaffe.m
5. run crop_chairs.m and prepare_chairs_64x64x3_crop.m for preparing the data
6. run matcaffe_generator_image_mask_conv_rgb_crop.m to train the model or,
7. test the pre-trained model by matcaffe_test_generator_image_mask_conv_rgb_crop.m
